# 2048 Game Katherene Lugo Deming Wang 

Our project involves implementing our own version of the popular 2048 game. Our game has some of the typical features of the regular game (merging, random tile pop up, win and lose). We have decided to add our own features: an AiAutoHelper and a (working) undo method. The Ai Autohelper essentially plays the game for the user, assessing the best moves given the state of the board. There is also an option for having this helper play one move for you as desired, choosing the best move given your current board.

The undo method however, is not fully implemented. When pressing the undo button, the user might not initially see any changes. However, after some clicks the state of the board does effectively begin changing back to its previous states. However, the usual random tiles show up a bit sporadically and are not effectively removed from the canvas. With more time and effort, our hope would have been to have this button working successfully after removing/fixing this bug.
